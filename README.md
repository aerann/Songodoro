# Technova2023

## Inspiration
As **university students in STEM**, it can be hard to find motivation and regulate your studying - especially after you just came back from a co-op or a relaxing summer. So, Songodoro was born. This project aims to give students that boost of motivation by introducing intervals of studying alongside customized (and novel!) study music. 

## What it does
Songodoro combines the Pomodoro technique with the Spotify API to give you a **refreshing focus playlist every single study session.** We're customizing the auto-generated playlist to your taste - analyzing your go-to songs to give you new favourites. 

The platform promotes productivity alongside novelty, intersecting music and study so that Pomodoro never gets old. 

## How we built it

We used a combination of HTML, CSS, and JS alongside the React framework to design the front-end and back-end. We also used Figma to create a low-fidelity mock-up -- UI/UX doesn't get left behind!

## Challenges we ran into

As novice coders, we learned a lot of new skills *while* coding this project. In the beginning, 3/4 of us didn't even have React installed on VSCode, but now we're intimately familiar with the nooks and crannies of the library. 

For the front-end, we struggled to build a specific timer with the specific Pomodoro criteria. 
For the back-end, it was difficult wrestling with the Spotify API -- neither of us worked with APIs before, and MAN! I sure know what 400 and 502 error codes means now!  

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

We're really glad that we were able to preserve through the obstacles and keep pushing despite the tedious bugs that we encountered. We're also really glad that we chose something feasible in the end, as we started off with super technologically intensive ideas.... but they were completely out of our skill range. This project was great for challenging us, without completely destroying our morale (for now.)

## What we learned

Altogether, we were able to really familiarize ourselves with these languages (HTML, CSS, JS) and became a lot more comfortable working with React. We also gained experience working with APIs and designing a simplistic but elegant website. We're super excited to have competed in this event to hone our programming skills and knowledge. 

## What's next for Songodoro
We'd love to expand Songodoro in the future by adding more features. These include: 
- More specific genre selections (Maybe you don't want to study to relaxing music?)
- Having the timer be more flexible 
- Cleaning and optimizing the code
